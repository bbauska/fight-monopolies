Steps/tips on fighting monopolies in America.

After nearly four decades of lax antitrust policy, during which a handful of corporations have 
been allowed to gobble up market share like a horde of deranged amoebas, the consequences of 
unfettered monopoly have become painfully apparent. Competition has fizzled, replaced by pockets 
of extreme concentration. The number of new businesses has plunged. Wages have stagnated. 
Inequality has spiked. And extreme wealth—alongside its evil twin, extreme power—has pooled in 
fewer and fewer hands.

Mercifully, smart minds have been busy mulling smart solutions, brainstorming ways to begin reining 
in today’s mega-monopolies. Here are six suggestions. —The Nation

1. Hold field hearings on the impact of concentrated economic power
Many Americans feel the consequences of monopoly in their daily lives. Nurses in Michigan saw their 
income depressed by an estimated <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20161025_monopsony_labor_mrkt_cea.pdf">
20 percent</a> as a result of alleged collusion among dominant hospitals seeking to keep labor costs 
low. Dairy farmers in the Southeast contend they have been 
<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/01/23/170015186/farmers-and-their-cooperative-settle-lawsuit-on-fixing-the-price-of-milk">
denied a fair price</a> for their milk by two dominant firms that control the processing and 
distribution of milk. Independent pharmacists say that CVS Health, which manages prescription 
benefits on behalf of many insurers, has been <a href="https://prospect.org/health/abusing-drugs/">abusing that power</a> to reduce reimbursement rates 
for local pharmacists, with an eye to putting them out of business. Air travelers in the United States continue to 
<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/04/22/a-lack-of-competition-explains-the-flaws-in-american-aviation">
pay inflated ticket prices</a>, even as the cost of jet fuel, a major expense for the airlines, has fallen by more than half since 2014.

It’s no wonder that about 
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/02/10/most-americans-say-u-s-economic-system-is-unfair-but-high-income-republicans-disagree/">
two-thirds of Americans</a> believe the economic system “unfairly favors powerful interests.”

That sentiment should prompt members of Congress to organize regional field hearings to 
investigate the real-world impacts of concentrated economic power and engage citizens in a 
conversation about what to do about it.

For inspiration, they might draw on hearings held in the late 1930s by what newspapers at the 
time often referred to as the “Monopoly Committee.” Officially named the Temporary National 
Economic Committee, it had been established jointly by Congress and the Roosevelt administration 
to investigate the causes and effects of concentration. The committee heard testimony from 552 
people over a three-year period, and its findings laid the groundwork for stepped up antitrust 
enforcement for years to come.

2. Bring daylight to the nation’s antitrust agencies
Both the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)—the two agencies 
that share the task of enforcing US antitrust laws—regularly close investigations and approve 
mergers without offering any explanation to the public. In 2012, for example, Obama’s DOJ 
closed a three-year investigation of the agricultural-chemical producer Monsanto—a case 
closely followed in rural America—without issuing a statement. Nor did the DOJ explain its 
reasons, in 2013, for abruptly reversing course on the merger of US Airways and American 
Airlines, initially suing to block the merger, and then, a few months later, okaying it with 
only minor concessions from the companies.

Moreover, it’s only because of an 
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-u-s-antitrust-probe-of-google-1426793274">
inadvertent disclosure</a> of documents to The Wall Street Journal a few years ago that we know 
that officials at the FTC concluded in 2012 that Google was abusing its monopoly power in ways 
that had resulted “in real harm to consumers and to innovation in the online search and 
advertising markets.” Staff from the agency’s competition division had recommended that the FTC 
file suit against the company, but the agency’s commissioners voted against that 
recommendation—and kept the public in the dark about the fact that it had been made.

Antitrust policy has been allowed to slip into the bureaucratic shadows, becoming the domain of a 
small cadre of people. It now suffers from what the scholars Harry First and Spencer Weber Waller 
have described as a debilitating <a href="https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4890&context=flr">“democracy deficit.”</a>

It wasn’t always this way. When Franklin Roosevelt decided, in his second term, that restoring 
prosperity would require breaking the grip of dominant corporations, he hired a spirited lawyer 
from Wyoming named Thurman Arnold to run the DOJ’s Antitrust Division. Arnold believed that, to 
take on titans like Dupont and Alcoa, he would need to build broad support for the agency’s 
mission. Soon after taking the job, he made the case for stepped-up action against monopolies in 
an essay penned for his fellow citizens and published in The New York Times Magazine. Under his 
direction, the division opened regional offices across the country to uncover antitrust violations, 
and it began issuing detailed public statements with every case it prosecuted. Within two years, 
the division’s caseload had grown eightfold and its activities were regularly covered by the news 
media.

It’s time to bring this spirit of transparency and public oversight back to the DOJ and the FTC.

3. Set a higher bar for approving mergers
About <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2017/07/27/americas-uncompetitive-markets-harm-its-economy">
three-quarters</a> of industries are more concentrated than they were 20 years ago, and much of 
this increase has been fueled by mergers. The tipping point came in 1982, when Ronald Reagan’s DOJ 
adopted new guidelines for reviewing mergers. Prior to this, the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/atr/1968-merger-guidelines">DOJ’s merger guidelines</a> had focused 
on market structure, and embodied the idea that having many competitors in an industry generally 
produced the best outcomes. The guidelines even stipulated specific market-share thresholds that 
would generally cause a merger to be opposed by the government.

The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/atr/1968-merger-guidelines">1982 guidelines</a> represented a radical change in thinking. They were the culmination of an 
ideological movement led by Robert Bork, a prominent legal scholar and Nixon’s solicitor general. 
Bork believed that the only aim of antitrust policy should be maximizing efficiency, which would 
lead to lower prices. His “consumer welfare standard” has been the centerpiece of merger policy 
ever since, embraced by both Democratic and Republican administrations.

As a consequence, merger reviews have become highly technical affairs, hinging on complex economic 
analyses. If the corporations involved can show that the merger will produce efficiencies that open 
the way for lower prices, then their marriage plans generally win the DOJ’s blessing.

As it turns out, however, these economic models are not very good at predicting future prices. John 
Kwoka, an economics professor at Northeastern University, recently studied the outcomes of dozens 
of major mergers. In 75 to 80 percent of the cases, he found, they had led to sizable price 
increases. Meanwhile, new scholarship has concluded that rising concentration is pushing down wages 
and causing other problems, like 
<a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2016/03/14/the-real-reason-middle-america-should-be-angry/">
widening geographic disparities</a>, that current merger-review policy sidelines as irrelevant 
considerations.

It’s time to dump Bork’s consumer-welfare standard and bring back an approach to reviewing mergers 
that recognizes that promoting competition, not efficiency, best serves the public interest. Altering 
the merger guidelines is something a future administration could do—as could the current one, at least 
in theory—and the idea is beginning to find some traction. Last year, the Democratic Party released a 
platform of proposals that included creating new standards for reviewing mergers. And in December, the 
Senate’s bipartisan Antitrust Subcommittee held a 
<a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/the-consumer-welfare-standard-in-antitrust-outdated-or-a-harbor-in-a-sea-of-doubt">
hearing</a> on whether the consumer-welfare standard is outdated. Although four of the five invited 
witnesses, including two conservatives and two liberals, 
<a href="https://prospect.org/economy/rehabilitation-antitrust/">argued for keeping it</a> (though they 
differed on whether to enforce it with more vigor), that the discussion took place at all was 
nevertheless a breakthrough.

4. Break up Big Tech
Google, Facebook, and Amazon pose such a fundamental threat to American democracy that the only 
rational solution is to break them up.

These companies command markets to a degree that makes agribusiness and airline giants seem meek by 
comparison. Google controls <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a15895746/bust-big-tech-silicon-valley/">
92 percent</a> of internet searches. Last year, Google and Facebook attracted an estimated 
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cf362186-d840-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482">84 percent</a> of global 
spending on digital advertising, excluding China. Amazon owns over 70 percent of the market for 
e-books and, through the spread of Alexa, 
<a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a15895746/bust-big-tech-silicon-valley/">71 percent</a> 
of the in-home voice market.

One reason these pervasive digital platforms constitute an existential danger is that they control 
the fates of so many other businesses. Retailers and manufacturers at once compete with Amazon and 
depend on it to reach the market. Media companies are beholden to the algorithms of Facebook and 
Google. Google has used its control of search to 
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-u-s-antitrust-probe-of-google-1426793274">
privilege</a> its own travel and shopping services, while marginalizing those of rivals. In 2013, 
Facebook bought a tiny start-up, Onavo, and used its technology to 
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-copycats-how-facebook-squashes-competition-from-startups-1502293444">
spy on smartphone users</a> as a way to detect popular new apps early and then either buy them or 
copy their functionality.

A second reason these firms have become dangerous is that they control the flow of ideas and 
information—an arrangement no democracy can tolerate. They mediate our interactions, and they 
decide which sites show up when we search; which news stories, real and fake, we encounter in 
our feeds; and which books we run across. Surveillance is a central strategy of all three of 
these tech monopolies. And they all use the extensive data they’ve gathered about us to hinder 
upstart competitors, keep us tuned into their services, and otherwise sustain their dominant 
positions.

What would breaking up these companies look like? It would essentially mean removing the 
conflicts of interest at the heart of these digital giants by compelling them to spin off 
their platforms, which provide market access for other firms, from the other parts of their 
business that compete with those same firms.

That process would likely begin with an antitrust investigation. Last November, Missouri 
Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican, launched an 
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-13/google-faces-missouri-investigation-as-antitrust-concerns-grow">
antitrust investigation of Google</a>. His office is looking at, among other things, whether 
Google manipulates search results to favor its own products over those of its competitors, in 
violation of the state’s antitrust laws. It would be a promising development if other state 
attorneys general, who have broad authority to protect their citizens from monopolies, did the 
same. Many of the nation’s most pivotal antitrust cases, including those that led to the break-up 
of Standard Oil and the almost-break-up of Microsoft, were first initiated by state investigations 
and later taken up by federal antitrust enforcers.

5. Block big corporations from using their financial might to crush smaller competitors
Today’s monopolists have found that they don’t have to out-compete their smaller competitors to 
gain market share. Instead, they can use their size and financial resources to muscle them aside.

Walmart, for instance, 
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-food-faces-pressure-from-retailers-demanding-discounts-1504216666">
demands</a> that, for 80 percent of the groceries it buys, suppliers offer it prices that are 15 
percent lower than those they give to its competitors. And Walmart has such a commanding share of 
the nation’s grocery market that many suppliers feel they must comply. As a result, independent 
grocers and competing chains, even those buying at high volumes, pay more. Over time, they’ve lost 
ground to Walmart, which, in 2015, captured half of grocery sales in more than 
<a href="https://grist.org/business-technology/walmart-is-quietly-going-on-a-massive-building-spree/">
40 metro areas</a>.

Amazon, meanwhile, has routinely flexed another monopoly muscle available to deep-pocketed companies: 
selling goods below cost. When the online shoe retailer Zappos soared in popularity in the mid 2000s, 
Amazon began selling shoes at loss, eventually losing an estimated $150 million. The strategy worked: 
Unable to sustain similar money-losing prices, Zappos agreed to a merger. Today, Zappos is Amazon.

Amazon’s investors, content to forgo present returns for future market dominance, have happily 
supported this strategy, and the company has used it repeatedly. It bled money on diapers to 
capsize and eventually buy Quidsi, the firm behind Diapers.com, and for years, sold books at a 
loss to squeeze out competing booksellers.

US antitrust law technically bans this kind of behavior. Predatory pricing, or selling goods below 
cost with the intent of harming competition, is illegal under the Sherman Act, while price 
discrimination, achieved by demanding special discounts from suppliers, is prohibited by the 
Robinson-Patman Act. Congress passed the latter in 1936 in response to the growing power of the 
A&P grocery chain. The idea behind these laws was that companies should win by competing, not by 
using their financial resources to warp markets in their favor. And for a long time they worked: 
A&P grew to be a national grocer, but it never overwhelmed the food industry to the degree Walmart 
has.

What changed is that, in the 1980s, as the consumer welfare framework took hold, the US Supreme 
Court began to shift how it viewed predatory pricing and price discrimination cases. Consumers, 
the Court reasoned, were benefitting from lower prices. It therefore set an almost impossibly 
high bar for ruling against such behavior, even if it harmed competition. “While predatory pricing 
technically remains illegal, it is extremely difficult to win predatory pricing claims,” 
<a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">notes</a> Lina Khan, a 
legal scholar with the Open Markets Institute.

Khan argues that the doctrine the Supreme Court adopted in the 1980s to analyze predatory pricing 
cases urgently needs to be revisited. This is especially true in light of “the economics of 
platform markets, where firms can sink money for years given unlimited investor backing.” That 
kind of shift in jurisprudence will take patient work by legal scholars, attorneys, and judges. 
But the good news is that that work has already begun, led by Khan and others.

6. Pass anti-monopoly policies at the local level
Antitrust policy is critically important, but it’s not the only way that public policy shapes the 
economy and structures markets. Nor is this policy-making capacity confined to the federal level. 
Cities and states can take significant steps to protect their citizens from monopolies, while 
dispersing opportunity and promoting competition. (My organization, the Institute for Local 
Self-Reliance, focuses on providing policy ideas to help them do so.)

A growing number of places are taking up the cause. In a statewide 
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democratic-party-future-rural_n_58b7089ee4b019d36d0fecb4">
referendum</a> in 2016, Oklahoma voters strongly favored a policy to check the power of large 
agribusiness. A few years ago, Jersey City 
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-26/saving-main-street-with-zoning">
capped how much space chain retailers may occupy in its downtown</a>, as part of a broader 
effort that has led to the opening of hundreds of new local businesses. In 2014, the citizens 
of North Dakota voted overwhelmingly to 
<a href="https://ilsr.org/articles/big-win-local-ownership-north-dakota-votes-states-pharmacy-law/">
keep their state’s pharmacy ownership law</a>, which mandates that pharmacies be independently 
owned and has <a href="https://ilsr.org/articles/report-pharmacy-ownership-law/">largely spared 
North Dakotans</a> from the higher prices and other harms that the rest of the country is seeing 
as a result of concentration in the prescription benefits industry.

Cities are also sidestepping monopolies by creating their own public options. 
<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-17-166A1.pdf">Half</a> of US households have, 
at most, only one provider to choose from for high-speed Internet access. While the federal 
government has been content to let these monopolies maintain their chokehold, many municipalities 
have not been. <a href="https://communitynets.org/content/community-network-map">Dozens have built 
their own publicly owned high-speed fiber networks.</a> As a result, some of the country’s best 
Internet service is now found in out-of-the-way places, like Ammon, Idaho; and Wilson, North 
Carolina. And, unlike the private monopolies they compete with, these public options have no 
intention of abandoning net neutrality.

Scanning the country with this lens, it’s possible to trace the broad outlines of an anti-monopoly 
movement—one whose geography, it’s worth noting, suggests a latent potential to rearrange America’s 
divided electoral map. Right now, though, these scattered uprisings are not linked as part of a 
common cause.

Something similar was happening in 
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/word-monopoly-antitrust/530169/">
1920s and 1930s,</a> another period of high levels of economic concentration, when farmers were 
challenging the power of Wall Street and small towns were fighting the grocery giant A&P. It was 
Franklin Roosevelt who helped people see that monopoly was the root problem. “Today we stand 
committed to the proposition that freedom is no half-and-half affair,” he said, as he accepted 
his party’s nomination for the presidency in 1936. “If the average citizen is guaranteed equal 
opportunity in the polling place, he must have equal opportunity in the market place.”

Today’s political leaders have an opening to do what Franklin did. It’s up to us to help them see 
and grasp that opportunity. We can do that by passing local laws to limit the reach of monopolies 
in our own communities and demanding transparency from the nation’s antitrust enforcers. Most 
important, we need to speak up about the ways monopoly is affecting our own lives—ideally at a 
series of congressional field hearings.

George Zornick

<h2>It all started when?</h2>

It all started with morbidly rich men (it was all men back then) who wanted to use the 
threat of a “communist menace” to gut the union movement to increase their own corporate 
profits and CEO pay.

The founding premise of the modern conservative movement tracks back a generation before 
Stormer’s book to a Republican thought leader named Russell Kirk. He laid it out in his 
1951 book The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot, as I detail in The Hidden History 
of American Oligarchy.

Kirk argued that the middle class was becoming a threat to America; without clearly defined 
classes and power structures — essentially without the morbidly rich in complete control of 
everything — he worried that society would devolve into chaos.

The opening chapter of his book was about Edmund Burke, the Irish conservative who wrote, in 
1790, that hairdressers and candlemakers should not be allowed to run for political office or 
even to vote:

“The occupation of a hairdresser or of a working tallow-chandler cannot be a matter of honor 
to any person — to say nothing of a number of other more servile employments. Such descriptions 
of men ought not to suffer oppression from the state; but the state suffers oppression if such 
as they, either individually or collectively, are permitted to rule. In this you think you are 
combating prejudice, but you are at war with nature...”

Kirk and his followers essentially predicted in 1951 that if today’s “hairdressers and working 
tallow-chandlers” — college students, women, working-class people, and people of color — ever 
got even close to social and political power at the same level as wealthy white men, there 
would essentially be a communist revolution in the US, handing us over to Stalin and his 
Politburo.

(Keep in mind, this was when racial segregation was legal and brutally enforced, the voting 
age was 21, campuses were almost entirely all-male, both abortion and birth control were 
illegal in most states, and women couldn’t open checking accounts or get credit cards without 
a husband’s, brother’s, or father’s signature.)

Throughout the 1950s, Kirk and his warnings of the dangers of an activist middle-class developed a 
small following; the most prominent of his proponents were William F. Buckley Jr. and Barry 
Goldwater. Most Republicans, though, considered him a crackpot.

But when the birth-control pill was legalized in 1961 and the Vietnam War heated up a few 
years later, those marginalized groups Kirk had warned his wealthy white male followers about 
began to rise up in protest.

Kids were burning draft cards, women were burning bras, and Martin Luther King Jr. was leading 
a movement for racial justice that the white power structure blamed for American cities burning. 
Gay liberation was also having a moment.

Meanwhile, the Arab Oil Embargoes of the 1970s had lit the flame of inflation, and unionized 
workers were striking all over America for wage increases to keep up with the rising cost of 
living.

Wealthy white conservatives freaked out as the morbidly rich promoted the idea that America 
was experiencing a “moral decline” that could only be fixed by ending the union movement and 
other “liberal” causes that shared the union movements’ populist goals.

They became convinced that they were seeing Kirk’s prophecy play out in real time on their 
television screens every night: the “communists” — those uppity racial minorities, women who’d 
forgotten their “rightful place in society,” students who objected to Vietnam, unionized 
workers, and gender minorities — were on the verge of “taking over” America.

These five movements all hitting America at the same time got the attention of conservatives 
and Republicans who had previously ignored or even ridiculed Kirk back in the 1950s. Suddenly, 
America’s most powerful and well-known conservative commentators (like William F. Buckley Jr.) 
were telling Republicans that Russell Kirk was, indeed, a prophet.

They’d finally found a politically acceptable “hook” to destroy the wealth of working-class 
people and transfer trillions into their own money bins: fear of communism and a prophesied 
social decay caused by an activist middle class.

The Republican/Conservative “solution” to the “crisis” these five movements represented was 
put into place in 1981 when Ronald Reagan was sworn into office: the explicit goal of the 
morbidly rich white men funding the so-called Reagan Revolution was to take the middle class 
down a peg to end the protests of the ’60s and ’70s, restore “social stability,” and increase 
corporate profitability.

Their plan was to declare war on labor unions so wages could slide back down again, end free 
college across the nation so students would live in fear rather than be willing to protest, 
and increase the penalties Nixon had already put on drugs so they could use those laws 
against their scapegoats, particularly the hippy antiwar protesters and Black people demanding 
an end to police killings. They also wanted to outlaw abortion, to put women “back in their 
place.”

Thus, Reagan massively cut taxes on rich people and raised taxes on working-class people 11 
times. For example, he put income taxes on Social Security and unemployment payments, and put 
in a mechanism to track and tax tips income, all of which had previously been tax-free but 
were exclusively needed and used by middle-class people.

He ended the tax deductibility of credit-card, car-loan, and student-debt interest, 
overwhelmingly claimed by working-class people. At the same time, he cut the top tax 
bracket for millionaires and billionaires from 74% to 25%. (There were only a handful of 
billionaires in America then, in large part because of previous tax policies; today’s 
democracy-destroying explosion of billionaires followed Reagan’s, Bush’s, and Trump’s 
massive tax cuts on the rich.)

Reagan declared war on labor unions, crushed PATCO in less than a week, and over the next 
decade the result of his war on labor was that union membership went from about a third of 
the American workforce when he came into office to around 10% at the end of the Reagan/Bush 
presidencies. It’s just now beginning to recover from its low of 6% of the private workforce.

He and Bush also husbanded the moribund 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades (GATT, 
which let Clinton help create the WTO) and negotiated NAFTA, which Clinton signed and thus 
opened a floodgate for American companies to move manufacturing overseas, leaving American 
workers underemployed while radically cutting corporate labor costs and union membership.

And, sure enough, Reagan’s War on Labor cut average inflation-adjusted minimum and median 
wages by more, over a couple of decades, than anybody had seen since the Republican Great 
Depression of the 1920s and ’30s.

The billionaire’s investment in taking the middle-class down a peg was paying off by 
orders of magnitude.

Had Reagan not destroyed the nation’s unions, the median American income today would be 
well over $100,000 a year, minimum-wage households would have a family income of $86,000, 
and a single wage-earner would still be able to buy a house, a car, send the kids to 
college, and have a decent retirement (as my dad did, working a union job for 35 years in 
a tool-and-die shop).

Instead, CEOs today keep all that money for themselves and their investors.

And Reagan’s War on Colleges jacked up the cost of education so high that an entire 
generation is today saddled with more than $1.5 trillion in student debt: as predicted, 
many aren’t willing to jeopardize it all by “acting up” on campuses.

The key to selling this campaign of impoverishment to the American people to help out the 
billionaire class was the idea that the US shouldn’t protect the rights of workers, 
subsidize education, grant women equal rights, or enforce Civil Rights laws because, 
conservatives said, all of those things were aspects of “socialism.” And if America 
embraced socialism, we may as well be ruled by the Soviet Union.

As Reagan told us in his first inaugural, government “socialist” programs were not the 
solution to our problems, but instead were the problem itself.

He ridiculed the formerly-noble idea of service to one’s country and joked that there 
were really no good people left in government because if they were smart or competent 
they’d be working in the private sector for a lot more money.

He even told us that the nine most frightening words in the English language were, “I’m 
from the government, and I’m here to help.”

Following Lewis Powell’s 1971 memo, throughout the 1970s and 1980s Republican billionaires 
built a massive infrastructure of think tanks and media outlets to promote and amplify 
Reagan’s message that government supports of any sort for poor or working-class people 
were simply gateway drugs to socialism and, inevitably, communism.

It so completely swept America that by the 1990s even President Bill Clinton was saying 
things like, “The era of big government is over,” and “This is the end of welfare as we 
know it.” Limbaugh, Hannity and other right-wing radio talkers were getting millions a 
year in subsidies from billionaire-funded groups like the Heritage Foundation. 
Billionaire-owned Fox “News” today carries on the tradition.

It had been a pretty good scam for the billionaires who owned the GOP and wanted, back 
in the 1950s, to stop the union movement that was forcing them to share their profits 
with their workers.

First, they terrified Americans about communism and socialism, then convinced about half of us 
that those things came straight out of “liberal” social and economic movements.

Unions, feminism, acceptance of the queer community, civil rights, minimum wage increases, and 
even regulation of corporate behavior would, they told us, all lead to Soviet-style tyranny.

So, to save America from herself, Reagan gutted the American middle class, transferring over 
$50 trillion in wealth from working class people into the money bins of the morbidly rich.

By 2016, Americans were starting to figure out that they’d been screwed — and that Hillary 
Clinton’s husband had been in on it by continuing Reagan’s policies and doubling-down on free 
trade — and were loudly demanding change.

Into this maelstrom walked Donald Trump, proclaiming himself the savior of the country. In the 
GOP primary he pointed out how corrupt his opponents were, particularly Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, 
and destroyed them, one after the other.

For the general election in 2016, he changed his tune and ran on what was traditionally a 
Democratic platform, saying he was going to bring jobs home, end so-called “free trade” 
policies, raise taxes on the rich so much that “my friends won’t talk to me anymore,” and 
make sure every American had free or low-cost healthcare and access to an affordable college 
education.

They were all lies — something Trump had become adept at during his business career — but 
they worked and sucked in disaffected workers who knew they’d been screwed but weren’t sure 
who did it to them or why.

So here we are.

We have an open fascist and apparent friend of authoritarian Russia as president after being 
convicted by a jury of his peers on 34 felony charges, having previously been adjudicated as 
responsible for sexual abuse (the judge called it “rape”) and fraud.

He’s putting into place people and policies that could turn America into an authoritarian 
nation like Russia or Hungary, and apparently wants to re-align the United States away from 
NATO and the EU and toward Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.

We are literally facing the authoritarian future that John Stormer was warning us about back 
in 1964. Only instead of “communists” in the State Department, it’s a billionaire president 
with the avowed goal of ending union rights and locking up or using the Army with live ammunition 
against those who protest his policies.

And it all tracks back to wealthy conservatives funding a project in the 1960s to scare Americans 
about socialism and communism so they could stop the union-fueled growth of wages that were 
cutting into their profits.

Perhaps none dare call it treason. But I do.
